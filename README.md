# EA-Storage
This repository is to save my works of EA. I will distribute EAs implemented in my own way, from simple trading strategy steps to application steps. And I will briefly explain what strategy each EA was implemented based on, what logic it was implemented with, and what purpose it was implemented with.

The version update status of each EA is listed in descending order starting from the latest version.
The EA operating platform is MT4 (Meta Trader 4), and most EAs are implemented in MQL4 (Meta Quotes Language 4). In the future, we plan to convert EAs with the same logic to run on MT5 and distribute the two EAs together.
